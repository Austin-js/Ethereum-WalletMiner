This is a Python file that can generate random private keys and check if it has ETH in it.

You will first need to install the web3 module:
`pip install web3`

You will then need a private node, as the free nodes will not allow you to handle that many requests in a short amount of period.
You can try getting a node from https://www.quicknode.com/
Once you get a node, insert the node in the `settings.json` file

Keep in mind that the chance of actually getting one is at `6.73*10^(-67)`%, or basically 0%.
This program is only made for fun - but if you really wanna use it, you'll never know ;)
